 <li> Write code to implement the Karatsuba multiplication algorithm in the file linked in Assignment 2 (karatsuba.cpp) in Canvas (please do not rename file or use <strong>cout/cin</strong> statements in your solution). As a reminder, the algorithm uses recursion to produce the results, so make sure you implement it as a recursive function. Please develop your code in small</li>

</ol>

The test program (karatsuba_test.cpp) is also given. PLEASE DO NOT MODIFY THE TEST FILE.  <u>Upload only the completed karatsuba.cpp file.</u> Make sure to double-check that you uploaded the correct file.

<ol start="2">

 <li> Write code for a function <strong>int sumDigits (int num)</strong> that will return the sum of the digits in an integer argument using recursion. The function must work for any integer entered. In <strong>main()</strong>, write a list of test cases (1 test per test case) and add comments for each test detailing what is being tested. Upload a single file named <u>cpp</u> with your code for <strong>sumDigits</strong> and <strong>main</strong>.</li>

 <li> Programs A and B are analyzed and found to have worst-case running times no greater than and , respectively. Answer the following questions:

  <ol>

   <li>Which program has the better guarantee on the running time for large values of N (N <em>&gt; </em>10,000)?</li>

   <li>Which program has the better guarantee on the running time for small values of N (N <em>&lt; </em>100)?</li>

   <li>Which program will run faster on average for N = 1000?</li>
